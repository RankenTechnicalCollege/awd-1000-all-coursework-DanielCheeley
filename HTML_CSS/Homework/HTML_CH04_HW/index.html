      <h2>Snowboarding:</h2>
      <!--Ignore error its just html5 validator for no inline styles-->
      <p style="font-size: 1.25em;">Snowboarding is a niche hobby that is very hard to get into and very expensive to get started.</p>
      <p class="mainp">I got lucky and got a board for cheap, but even then I still spent $700 on gear.</p>

      <h4>Why is it great despite these setbacks?</h4>
      <p class="mainp">Snowboarding is amazing because you can't do anything like it. Some say its like skateboarding, but those people have never been on a snowboard. You have to glide on the snow while riding edges without catching one and flipping over. While snowboarding you have to be switching edges constantly to regulate your speed; this is why snowboarders go from one side of the slope to the other, because they are regulating speed.</p>

      <h4>Where should you go to snowboard?</h4>
      <p class="mainp">The closest place to here is at Hidden Valley slopes. They offer a lot for being so close. If you decide to stick with it I would recomend taking a trip to the colorado slopes, as they are much more intense and they have real, softer snow.</p>

      <h4>What gear do you need?</h4>
      <h5>Board:</h5>
      <p class="mainp">For gear the first thing you need is a board. The board is based off your height, so the taller you are the longer the board.</p>
      <h5>Bindings:</h5>
      <p class="mainp">The next thing you need is a good set of bindings. Bindings are the straps that go on the board. There are two types: Standard, and snap ons. The standard bindings are more secure and take more time to get on and set up. In contrast the snap on bindings are less secure, but are extremely easy to put on and off.</p>
      <h5>Boots:</h5>
      <p class="mainp">Next you are going to need a good pair of boots. Make sure to get a size that fits just right so they don't fall off, or hurt your feet. Your boots will depend on the binding you chose earlier, because snap on bindings require a special type of boot.</p>
      <h5>Helmet and goggles:</h5>
      <p class="mainp">The helmet and goggles are more customizable than you think. You can pick from astetics, color, tint, or style. For the helmet you can also choose how warm you want it to be, and if you will be installing a speaker system. With this system you embed speakers and a mic in the helmet so you can listen to music or talk to friends on the slopes.</p>
      <h5>Clothes:</h5>
      <p class="mainp">Finally you get to choose your coat, gloves, and pants. For the coat choose one with padding and lots of insolation. Make sure to have lots of padding for the pants because thats where the force will most likely go if you fall. Make sure to have snowproof, insolated gloves, or your hands will get frostbite.</p>
