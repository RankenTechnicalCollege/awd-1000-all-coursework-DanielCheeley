    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP" target="_blank">Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a></dt>
    <dd>The fundamental protocol used on the web to exchange and transfer webpages. HTTP is a set of rules for exchanging text, graphics, audio, video, and other multimedia files on the web. When you tap or click a link on a webpage, your computer uses HTTP to connect to the server containing the page you want to view, and then to request and display the appropriate page.</dd>

    <dt>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>Used to exchange files from one computer to another over the Internet (not the web). The sole purpose of FTP is to exchange files; this protocol does not provide a way to view a webpage. Businesses commonly use FTP to exchange files with vendors and suppliers. Web designers often use FTP to transfer updated website content to a web hosting server, the computer that stores webpages and other related content for a website.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</a></dt>
    <dd>A pair of protocols used to transfer data efficiently over the Internet by properly routing it to its destination. TCP oversees the network connection between the data source and destination and micromanages the data. When data is sent over the Internet, TCP breaks the data into packets. Each packet contains addressing information, which the IP manages. One way to better understand TCP/IP is through an analogy of the postal system. The tasks TCP performs are similar to those workers or machines perform when handling a bundle of packages in a post office. In this analogy, the packages are addressed to one destination, but are too large to send as a single bundle. TCP breaks up the bundle into manageable pieces and then sends them out for delivery. When each piece arrives at the destination, TCP reassembles the bundle of packages.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite" target="_blank">Internet Protocol (IP)</a></dt>
    <dd>Ensures data is sent to the correct location. In the postal system analogy, the IP part of TCP/IP refers to the street address and zip code to route a piece of mail. Just as people have a unique mailing address, every client workstation and server on the Internet has a unique IP address. An example of an IP address is 192.168.1.5. Every website has a unique IP address, which makes it easy for computers to find websites. However, most people have difficulty in remembering and using IP addresses to access websites.</dd>

    <dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" target="_blank">Domain Name System (DNS)</a></dt>
    <dd>The Domain Name System (DNS) was created to resolve this issue. The DNS associates an IP address with a domain name. For example, the DNS associates the IP address 204.79.197.200 with the domain name bing.com.</dd>
