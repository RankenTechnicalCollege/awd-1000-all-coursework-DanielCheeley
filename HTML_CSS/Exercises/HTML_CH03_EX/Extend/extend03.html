            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>

            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Using descriptive file names is very useful for finding the right photo when you need it. This is because if they are just numbered or jumbled letters then you wont know what image to use when you code the image in.</p>

            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used paint to navigate to the home tab and resize the photo to 500x333</p>

            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the photo was 2121x1414</p>

            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">

            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used compressor.io to compress the jpeg file. The original size was 29KB and after compression it was 8KB</p>

            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5-min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass">

            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The image after compression is slightly more blurry than the one before, and the colors are a little brighter.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>

                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
                <svg width="100" height="100">
                <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="orange" stroke-width="20" fill="blue" />
                </svg>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
